He is most known for having very complex lyrics. He often uses a lot of figurative language that requires multiple listens to fully unpack and understand. This use of figurative language is what often draws fans in but has also been criticized for being to difficult to fully enjoy or understand. Regardless, Aesop's abstract lyrics have gained him plenty of mainstream attention and success.</h4>
