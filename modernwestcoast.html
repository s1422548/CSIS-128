The G-Funk is now usually mixed in with a lot more modern sounds such as trap beats and old soul music samples. These new west coast rappers are about as popular as the old school rappers were in their time. Below are some artists that fit into the modern west coast hip-hop genre.</h4>

        <div>
            <h4>
                Keenon Jackson AKA YG is a rapper from Compton, California.  Out of all the current west coast rappers, YG has arguably had the most radio success. Many of his songs have become chart toppers and have received a lot of radio play. He's done this by using the classic G-Funk sound and making it into it's own modern style. If you didn't know what era he was from, it would probably be very hard to guess it correctly. YG is known for his laidback, low-pitched flow.
