		<h1>Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope</h1>
		<p>In an attempt to take down the Empire's Death Star, the rebel alliance steals the plans
		for the Death Star. Princess Leia hides the plans in a droid named R2-D2 along with a hologram intended for Ben Kenobi.
		When Leia is captured the droids escape to a desert planet called Tatooine. A boy named Luke Skywalker purchases R2-D2 (as well as C-3PO)
		from some Jawa traders. Luke finds out that R2-D2 is looking for Ben Kenobi. They find Kenobi, and Luke learns that his father fought
		with Ben. He then gives Luke his father's lightsaber and he begins practicing to become a Jedi. Ben and Luke hire a smuggler named Han Solo to take them to Alderaan to
		bring the plans. They eventually discover that the planet is destroyed and run into the tractor beam of the Death Star.
		While there, the group rescues Leia. Ben also encounters Darth Vader the main leader of the Empire. Sadly, Vader kills Kenobi while the rest of the group is able to
		escape to Yavin IV. There, the Rebels devise a plan to destroy the Death Star. Luke uses his X-Wing fighter to destroy the Death Star while Darth Vader gets away.
		The movie concludes with the Rebels celebrating back on their base at Yavin IV.</p>
